## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd attendance-system
   ```

3. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

5. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. The application should now be running locally on `http://localhost:5000`.

## How to Use

- **Admin** can manage users, track attendance, and communicate with students and teachers.
- **Teachers** can mark attendance and communicate with students.
- **Students** can view their attendance and receive communications from the system.

## Future Improvements
